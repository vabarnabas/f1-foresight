## About The Project

![product-screenshot](docs/site.png)

I am a Formula 1 fan since early 2023 and always wanted to do a project around this amazing sport, and now it is done. F1 Foresight is a site where people can make predictions about the podiums of upcoming races. It also uses Gen AI to analyze these predictions and help the users make better predictions in the future.

Please note, F1 Foresight is not an official product of Formula 1 or Liberty Media and is in no way affiliated with the companies.
